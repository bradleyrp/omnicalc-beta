OMNICALC
========

The "omnicalc" codes are designed to analyze large
biophysical simulation datasets while reducing the 
scientific methods and bookkeeping to only a few, 
relatively easy-to-read python codes and markup files.
The omnicalc pipeline works well with 
[automacs](http://github.com/bradleyrp/automacs) codes for 
designing simulations.

Requires
--------

	1. Python version 2.7 or higher
	2. GROMACS (any version)
	3. hdf5 libraries for writing files
	4. Numpy, Scipy, and MDAnalysis Python libraries
	5. Sphinx for documentation
	
Installation
------------

Download and run ``make help`` for instructions.
Run ``make config`` to set paths. Run ``make docs`` to generate 
documentation which explains the pipeline further
