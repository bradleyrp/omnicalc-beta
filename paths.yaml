### OMNICALC PATHS

# write "slices" and postprocessing data to the post_data_spot
post_data_spot: post
# plots are written to a separate directory
post_plot_spot: plot
# the workspace is represented in a local file
workspace_spot: workspace
# omnicalc looks for simulation data in a "spot" containing folders, each of which holds a simulation
# development! default spot sets the cursor location
default_spot: Null
# omnicalc will store timestamps in the workspace but timekeeper tells it to also write them to post
timekeeper: True 
spots:
  # colloquial name for the "spot"
  simulations:
    # name downstream postprocessing data according to the spot name (above) and simulation folder (top)
    # note: that namer is set by default to take a simulation number and save "e.g. v1000.my_calc.dat"
    # hint: if you have multiple spots then you *must* use spot in the namer or you violate uniqueness
    namer: "lambda spot,top : 'v'+re.findall('membrane-v([0-9]+)',top)[0]"
    # parent location of the spot_directory (may be changed if you mount the data elsewhere)
    route_to_data: /home/rpb/omicron
    # path of the parent directory for the simulation data
    # note: that omnicalc joins route_to_data and spot_directory only propagates this information via namer
    # hint: this means that you can move the data but make sure namer doesn't lose track of the spot
    spot_directory: dataset-project-ptdins
    # rules for parsing the data in the spot directories
    regexes:
      # each simulation folder in the spot directory must match the top regex
      top: '(membrane-v[0-9]+)'
      # each simulation folder must have trajectories in subfolders that match the step regex (can be null)
      # note: you must enforce directory structure here with not-slash
      step: '([stuv])([0-9]+)-([^\/]+)'
      # each part regex is parsed by omnicalc
      part: 
        xtc: 'md\.part([0-9]{4})\.xtc'
        trr: 'md\.part([0-9]{4})\.trr'
        edr: 'md\.part([0-9]{4})\.edr'
        tpr: 'md\.part([0-9]{4})\.tpr'
        # specify a "structure" part for get_last_start_structure
        structure: '(system|system-input|structure)\.(gro|pdb)'
