Concept
=======

*Omnicalc* is a framework for analyzing biophysical simulations with minimal, compact, human readable analysis functions, parameter sweeps, and elegant plotting functionality. The codes are designed to cleave the scientific analysis components from the bookkeeping and data structures required to run hundreds of different simulations. This separation is literal: omnicalc manages the bookkeeping while a separate repository holds the analysis codes and specifications. These resulting analysis codes are easily shared between datasets and published in tandem with journal articles. In this way, the authors hope that omnicalc can contribute to ensuring that simulation analyses are both scalabe and reproducible.
